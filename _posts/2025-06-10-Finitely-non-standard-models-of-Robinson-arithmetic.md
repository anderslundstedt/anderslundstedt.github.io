title: "Finitely non-standard models of Robinson arithmetic"
---
I have just uploaded to my research section
[a draft of a chapter](../research/PhD-thesis/drafts/lundstedt_phd_thesis_ch_draft_fns_models_of_Q_20250610.pdf)
of my to-be-completed PhD thesis.

The chapter is a systematic study of *finitely non-standard models* of Robinson
arithmeticâ€”that is, it is a systematic study of those models of Robinson
arithmetic that have a finite non-empty set of non-standard numbers.

In addition to the chapter draft, I have also uploaded to my research section
Coq and Python source files corresponding to the sources referenced and included
verbatim in the draft.

In the process of completing my thesis, I expect no substantial changes to the
uploaded draft's content. In that sense the draft may be seen as an
all-but-finished version of the chapter. A sense in which it may not be seen
thus is given by its multitude of typographical mishaps: missing glyphs,
inconsistent vertical and horizontal spacings, margin overflows, et cetera.
These mishaps will of course be fixed before inclusion in the final version of
the thesis. Thus in case anyone wants to refer to the draft: do include the
version---that is, do include the date and time printed on the first page of the
draft.
